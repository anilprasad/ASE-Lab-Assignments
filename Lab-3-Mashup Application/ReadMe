This tutorial mainly aims on creating a web application with Mashup of two API's.

So I developed Mashup web application using Spotify and Alkhemy API.

Spotify
 1. With Spotify, it’s easy to find the right music for every moment. 
 2. There are millions of tracks on Spotify, so whether you’re working out, partying or relaxing, the right music 

Alkhemy
 1. The AlchemyAPI cloud platform creates smart apps easily  that deeply understand the world's conversations, reports and photos.
 2. We can align business with customer preferences and intent.
